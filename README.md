# Currency Converter Flutter App

## Overview
This is a simple Flutter application for converting USD to INR using a predefined exchange rate. The app uses a `MaterialApp` as the root widget and demonstrates the usage of `StatefulWidget` and `StatelessWidget`.

## Project Structure
- `lib/pages/home/matrial/currency_converter_matrial_page.dart`: The main page for currency conversion.
- `lib/pages/home/body/body.dart`: Contains the main UI of the currency converter, including the input field and conversion button.
- `lib/main.dart`: Entry point of the application.

## Key Concepts

### BuildContext
- **What is BuildContext?**
  - `BuildContext` is an important concept in Flutter. It provides the location of a widget in the widget tree. 
  - It is essential for navigating between pages and setting up themes, among other things.

### Widgets
- **StatelessWidget**
  - Used when the widget’s state does not change. Data in `StatelessWidget` is immutable.
- **StatefulWidget**
  - Used when the widget needs to change its state dynamically. Data in `StatefulWidget` is mutable.

### Comments and Best Practices
- **Use of `const`**
  - Always use `const` wherever possible to reduce unnecessary re-renders and optimize performance.
  - Avoid using containers when they don't need to be dynamic to prevent unnecessary rebuilds.

## App Features

### Currency Conversion
- The app converts a given amount in USD to INR using a fixed exchange rate.
- Error handling is implemented to ensure the user enters a valid amount before conversion.

### Theming
- The app supports both light and dark themes using `ThemeData` and `colorScheme`.

### Widgets Used
- **MaterialApp**
  - The root widget that wraps the entire app, providing navigation and theme support.
- **Scaffold**
  - Provides the basic structure of the visual interface, including the app bar and body.
- **TextEditingController**
  - Controls the text being edited and allows listening to changes.
- **ElevatedButton**
  - A button that triggers the conversion process.

## Running the App

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine.
3. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Future Improvements
- Integrate live exchange rates using an API.
- Implement additional currency conversions.
- Enhance the UI with animations and more custom styles.
